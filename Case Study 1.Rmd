## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
pm <- read.csv("http://aloy.rbind.io/data/PM.csv")
library(ggformula) # For plots
library(broom)     # for extracting compontents of lm objects
library(gridExtra) # grids of plots
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
gf_point(Particles ~ Cars, data = pm)%>%
  gf_labs(x = "Number of Cars that pass through and Intersection", y = "Particulate Matter levels (ppm)",
          title = "PM levels in the air vs.the number of cars that pass through an intersection")

summary(pm$Particles)
summary(pm$Cars)
```


```{r}
gf_point(Particles ~ Cars, data = pm)%>%
  gf_lm(Particles ~ Cars, data=pm)%>%
  gf_lm(interval = "prediction") %>%
  gf_lm(interval = "confidence", alpha = 0.6)
```
```{r}
pm_lm <- lm(Particles ~ Cars, data = pm)
pm_aug <- augment(pm_lm)
head(pm_lm)
gf_point(.resid ~ .fitted, data= pm_lm)%>%
  gf_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2)

summary(pm_lm)

```

```{r}
pm <- mutate(pm, log.Cars = log(Cars), log.Particles = log(Particles) )
pm_lm <- lm(log.Particles ~ log.Cars, data = pm)
tidy(pm_lm)


gf_point(log(Particles) ~ log(Cars), data = pm, alpha = 0.6,
xlab = "# of cars (log scale)", ylab = "Particles in PPM (log scale)") %>%
gf_lm(interval = "confidence")
```

```{r}
gf_point(Particles ~ Cars, data = pm, alpha = 0.6,
xlab = "CARS", ylab = "Particles") %>%
gf_lm(formula = log(y) ~ log(x), backtrans = exp, interval = "confidence")
```


```{r}
quadratic_lm <- lm(Particles ~ Cars + I(Cars^2), data = pm)
gf_point(Particles ~ Cars, data = pm, xlab = "Cars", ylab = "Particles") %>%
gf_lm(formula = y ~ x + I(x^2))
```
